# gCal-Uploader

gCal-Uploader is a small website project, designed to enable a little group of users to visit this webpage, drag and drop a excel file written in special format. This page would parse the content of the spreadsheet, let user choose google account, choose whose shift he/she wants to upload, and insert the shifts to google Calendar as events.
